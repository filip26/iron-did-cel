# Iron `did:cel` Agents, Services, and Storage

An experimental, modular, composable implementation of an Oblivious Witness Service and `did:cel` identifiers managed by Google Cloud KMS.

This repository provides services, agents, and libraries for creating, managing, witnessing, and verifying `did:cel` event logs in a secure and privacy-preserving way.


## 🛡️ Oblivious Witness Service

[Oblivious Witness Service](./witness-service)

Performs oblivious witnessing of event log. Issues signed and timestamped attestations over event log hashes using Google Cloud KMS in a serverless environment. Processes only cryptographic hashes and never accesses event log contents, preserving privacy while producing verifiable VD DI witness proofs. 

⚡ O(1) c14n, supports RDFC or JCS ⚡

Can be used independently of the `did:cel` ecosystem.

## 🔐 Managed `did:cel` Identifiers

A set of services, agents, and libraries that use Google Cloud KMS to create and manage secure `did:cel` identifiers. Components can be used independently or together.

- [Create Service](./create-service) 
  Creates a new `did:cel` bound to Google KMS key.
  
- [Heartbeat Agent](./heartbeat-agent)
  Heartbeat event generator assuring liveness and temporal continuity of an event log.
  
- [Identity Agent](./identity-agent)
  Acts on behalf of a DID controller to prove DID ownership.
  
- **Life-Cycle Listener**
  Reflects changes on KMS keys bound to `did:cel` in the event log (TBD).
  
- **Resolver**
  Resolves a given `did:cel` and validates its event log to produce the DID document (TBD).
  
- [Storage Service](./storage-service)
  GCS utilized as `CelStorageService`.
  
- [Witness Agent](./witness-agent)
  Coordinates oblivious witnessing of `did:cel` event logs for identifiers managed using Google KMS and GCS.
  
- [Witness Verifier](./witness-verifier)
  Simple library for verifying VCDI witness proofs in O(1).
